### CV search 
 
By id : 

To retrieve a CV using its id, send a GET request to localhost:8080/api/candidate/id, where id is the id of the requested CV. 
 
By date : 

To retrieve all CVs that have been uploaded after a certain date, send the following request : 
GET localhost:8080/api/candidate/date 
Use the format yyyy-mm-dd for date. The results appear in descending order. 
If the date is not specified no results will be returned. 

By keyword : 

Send a POST request to localhost:8080/api/candidate/search/keywords with a json body of the following structure : 
{
  "keywords": \["software engineer"\],
  "expRange": \[2,5\],
  "position": CDD
}

None of the attributes above are mandatory, but the request has to contain a body (empty or not).
A request with empty body returns all CVs in the index. 
One or both values of expRange can be null. 
To restrict the search on CVs uploaded after a certain date, send the request to localhost:8080/api/candidate/searchcreatedsince/date using the format yyyy-mm-dd for date. 
The results will appear in descending order of date.
